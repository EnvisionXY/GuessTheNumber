# GuessTheNumber
"Guess the Number" Game:  A self-coded "Guess the Number" game from a JavaScript course. Players guess a number between 1 and 20, receiving real-time feedback on each attempt. Win with the correct guess, and challenge the high score. A testament to my JavaScript skills and dedication to web development. Can you beat the game? ðŸŽ‰
