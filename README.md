Guess My Number!

This is a fun and interactive "Guess the Number" game created as part of a JavaScript course. The objective is to guess a random number between 1 and 20, with real-time feedback on each attempt. See if you can beat the high score and become the ultimate guesser!
How to Play

    Open the index.html file in your web browser.
    Enter your guess in the input field provided.
    Click the "Check!" button to see if your guess matches the secret number.
    Continue guessing until you find the correct number.
    If your guess is correct, you win! The background will turn green, and your score will increase.
    If your guess is incorrect, you'll receive a hint (too high or too low) and your score will decrease.
    To play again, simply click the "Again!" button.
